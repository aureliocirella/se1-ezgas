# Estimation approach

<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

# Estimate by product decomposition



### 

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 6                            |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 100                           | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 600 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 60                                     |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 1800 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 0.375                   |               


# Estimate by activity decomposition



### 

|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |
