Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
Itâ€™s important that the course thought how to use git, usually this is a given in real world work. 
It has been also appreciated the usage of Spring framework even if it would be better if there was a lesson about to make it easier to understand it. 
For some of us this was the first big project in which we could actually learn how to work in group to tackle a big problem hard to solve on your own. 
# Worst things
We have heavily suffered scarse support from professor and assistants. Sometimes there were unclear tasks that needed professor or assistants help. This has slowed down a lot the workflow. 
# Suggestions 
A lesson about Spring would have definitely improved our work and time organisation.
